# ELK_Enviroment
This repo contains the setup for an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). It aims to create a centralized logging and monitoring solution. Elasticsearch stores and searches data, Logstash collects and processes logs, and Kibana visualizes the data. This setup enhances system troubleshooting, performance analysis, and security monitoring.
