## How to Setup Vultr VPC and Server ##




## Objective

The objective of setting up a Vultr environment is to establish a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. This includes creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for isolated network management and deploying a server instance within this VPC. The setup allows for efficient hosting, enhanced security, and control over network resources, making it ideal for web applications, development environments, or business operations.
